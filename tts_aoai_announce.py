Developers can now “instruct” the model not just on what to say but how to say it—enabling more customised experiences for use cases ranging from customer service to creative storytelling.\n\nWe're also thrilled to share that the new gpt-4o-transcribe and gpt-4o-mini-transcribe models are now available to deploy in Azure OpenAI. These new speech to text models have improved word error rates and better language recognition and accuracy, compared to the original Whisper models.\n\nDeploy them in Azure AI Foundry, and try them today!"""
